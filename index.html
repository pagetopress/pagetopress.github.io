								<p>Well, I'm an Alpha Reader!</p>
								<p>
									<u id="What's an alpha reader?">Huh?</u>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Page to Press website pics.png" alt="" /></span>
									<br>
									These are readers who look at your writing before it's polished.
									<br>
									<br>
									As an alpha reader, I do my very best to provide honest and constructive feedback on your story, characters, plot and other elements of your manuscript. 
									<br>
									<br>
									It's my job to help you (the author) identify problems or weaknesses in your story and suggest ways to improve it. 
									I'm also going to be your number one cheerleader! - because your manuscript has the potential to become the next big thing and I'll make sure you know it!
									<br>
									<br>
								    <u id="Why use an alpha reader?">Okay...</u>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/okay....png" alt="" /></span>
									<br>
									Because we approach your work as a writer-reader - we help you find the holes and disjointed edges.
									<br>
									<br>
									When I alpha read, I look for these things within your manuscript:
									<ol>
										<li><b>Story Structure: </b>Does the story have a clear beginning, middle, and end? Are the events of the story logical and well-paced?</li>
										<li><b>Characters: </b>Are the characters well-developed and believable? Do they have distinct personalities and goals?</li>
										<li><b>Plot: </b>Is the plot engaging and compelling? Does it have sufficient conflict and tension to keep the reader interested?</li>
										<li><b>Setting: </b>Is the setting well-described and realistic? Does it enhance the story or detract from it?</li>
										<li><b>Theme: </b> Does the story have a clear theme or message? Is it effectively communicated through the events of the story?</li>
										<li><b>Continuity: </b>Are there any inconsistencies or discrepancies in the story?</li>
									</ol>
									I also consider the overall cohesiveness and effectiveness of 
									the manuscript as a whole, and may provide feedback and suggestions for improvement in any of these areas.
									<br>
									<br>
									If you're familiar with developmental editing, you may realize that a lot of what I offer coincides with developmental editing!
									<br>
									<br>
									That's why I'm an alpha reader that (sometimes) cancels out future developmental editing! This is a talent that's been honed for years and my customers find
									it to be true, again and again (you can read more on this in the Work section, under the Testimonials).
									<br>
									<br>
									<u id="What's the process?">Interesting.</u>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/interesting.png" alt="" /></span>
									<br>
									Well, I can't speak for other alpha readers but below is my process. And the first part of that process is Step Pitch. We're at Step Pitch right now, consuming the content on this website.
									<br>
									<br>
									Let's fast forward a bit to the point we've decided to work together. With Step Pitch out of the way, we move into;
									<ul>
									<br>
										<li><b>Step One: Exchanging of documents and assuaging of souls.</b>  
										<br>	
										Writers, by their very nature, are <i>very very very</i> protective of their babies.
										<br>
										<br>
										I get it because I'm a writer too! It's tough - letting go of your little one and having a stranger prepare to drop it on its head, give it a couple of kicks for good measure
										and toss it out with the trash. 
										<br>
										<br>
										Well, that's not what I do. 
										<br>
										<br>
										I treat your baby like I'd treat my own; with a fresh set of clothes, a warm bottle, and a nap against my bosom. And if you need me to
										convince you of this, I will! And if you need me to sign a contract, I will! I have my own template, or you can come prepped and ready with yours if you'd like!
										<br>
										<br>
										Once we've got this out of the way; </li>
										<br>
										<li><b>Step Two: You ask what you want from me and I get what I want from you. </b> 
										Some authors want to know more about their characters than their plot. Okay, coolio!
										Others want to know if the mechanics of their urban fantasy makes sense. Sure thing! Others want to know if the theme is too on the nose or can barely be defined. Sweet.
										Everyone wants to know something different so this is the part you send me questions. I'll make sure to keep a keen eye on those elements of the manuscript so you can get some answers!
										<br>
										<br>
										I also have a set of questions of my own. I ideate these questions after reading your story's synopsis and each question bank is unique to each story.</li>
										<br>
										<li><b>Step Three: I get to reading! </b>
										<br>
										And once I'm done, I send two documents back. 
										<br>
										<br>
										The first is a Word or Google Doc that details my thoughts and feelings as I read through
										your manuscript. (Now should be a good time to say I <b><i>ONLY</i></b> accept Word or Google doc files, for the aforementioned reason).
										<br>
										<br>
										And the second is a write-up, answering questions, providing feedback, giving thoughts. 
										<br>
										With those documents in your hands, we complete the transaction and voila! - it is finished.</li>
									</ul> 
									<u id="How much does it cost?">To Proceed Or Not To Proceed...</u>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/bargain..png" alt="" /></span>
									<br>
									Yes, bet you've been waiting for this one! Well, here's a table for your viewing pleasure.
									<br>
									<br>
									<table style="width:100%">
										<tr>
										  <th>Chapter</th>
										  <th>Novella</th>
										  <th>Novel</th>
										</tr>
										<tr>
										  <td>Up to 5000 words</td>
										  <td>Up to 50,000 words</td>
										  <td>Up to 100,000 words</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
										  <td>50 $</td>
										  <td>800 $</td>
										  <td>1600 $</td>
										</tr>

											<td>Within 3 days</td>
											<td>Within 7 days</td>
											<td>Within 14 days</td>

									<br>
									Please note, I only use the platform Wise (formerly TransferWise) as a means of payment. It's much cheaper than all viable alternatives - PayPal and the like -
									and lets me work with multiple currencies from my customers all around the world. Creating an account takes less than 5 minutes and it's a platform that was built
									especially for freelancers and their customers!
									<br>
									I also only start work with a 60% downpayment, with the remaining 40% after the deed is done (no, not <i>that</i> deed. The other deed - the one I made an entire website
									to explain). Thank you for understanding!

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I was a writer before I ever became a reader. And I started out as most writers do. On Wattpad. 
								<br>
								You remember those days when Wattpad was <b>the</b> site to be? 
								<br>
								Ah, the golden days.
								<br>
								<br>
								I started out reading fanfic. Back then, if you wanted to get traction, you left comments on other's work. I had a little fanfic of my own
								(that's since been scrapped from the internet) and the 30,000 odd reads I had wasn't enough. I had to have more.
								<br>
								<br>
								So I started leaving think-pieces on popular stories. The 2000 character limit was a hindrance but I did my best.
								Seeking greener pastures beyond the confines of Draco Malfoy X Reader fanfics,
								I became somewhat of a Wattpad legend - hundreds of people landed on my page, begging for a read and critique, 
								seeking whatever scraps I'd deign to throw at them. 
								Then one day I got an odd message.
								<br>
								<br>
								It was one of my favorite YA Wattpad writers at the time. She said she really enjoyed my critique (ME! A 13 year old with too much time on her hands! ME!)
								and thanked me for it. We had a little back and forth until she proposed an idea - what if I started a book on Wattpad that had all my critiques in one place? It could be used
								as both a guide to new Wattpaders on some of the better stories on the platform and a place to post critiques longer than 2000 words.
								<br>
								<br>
								It was a brilliant idea! So that's exactly what I did. For a time, I was Queen of Wattpad. I thought I was the coolest thing since sliced bread. Everyone came to my profile,
								seeking MY book to find recommendations for stories that weren't Werewolf self-inserts. It felt great. If you were on Wattpad during the golden years, you probably know me. Hello.
								<br>
								<br>
								But alas. I turned 14. Suddenly, I was a sophomore and Wattpad didn't seem so cool anymore. Being popular, makeup, boys and other teen stupidity did. So I left my spot as Queen of Wattpad.
								I was way more interested in being the Queen of Highschool. 
								And forget Wattpad I did. I ended up deleting that account when I was 16, after some 'friends' went through my phone and made fun of me using Wattpad (The Critique Workshop - imy).
								<br>
								<br>
								Soon enough, university came around. Writing was the farthest thing on my mind and the only thing I read were PowerPoint handouts. Then, I made a new friend.
								She was in the Creative Writing program. A completed novella was a requirement for a class in her second year and she asked me to have a read. I said yes.
								Poring over her manuscript reignited a fire in me that I'd forgetten existed. I finished all 8000 or so words within a day and sent her a long text with my thoughts.
								<br>
								<br>
								She loved it! After implementing some of my suggestions and sharing the final result with her writing workshop in class - making sure to sing my praises to her group - I had 4 budding writers begging for a read. 
								And so it began.					
								<br>
								<br>
								At some point in between college and employment, I figured I should start charging for my services. I've honed my talents so well to the point some of my customers skip developmental editing because I catch it all.
								I'm currently taking some editing classes right now so I can officially call myself a developmental editor but until I get that cert from a credited institute, I'll stick to being an alpha reader that works wonders on 
								your manuscript!
